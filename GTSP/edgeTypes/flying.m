% TODO: make the flying type of edge only, start with looking at the clusters and how they are working
% TODO: then look at how do I keep track of the distance which the UAV has to fly since each node will be only left to right or right to left
% TODO: Once I know how to keep track of the distance between the two nodes I can fill out the other 4 types of edges
